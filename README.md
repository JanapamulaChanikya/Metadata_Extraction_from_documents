# Metadata_Extraction_from_documents
This project automates the extraction of key information from rental agreement documents using text extraction combined with a Groq-based information extraction API. The goal is to accurately extract fields such as agreement value, start/end dates, renewal notice days, and involved parties, then validate these extractions against ground truth data.
